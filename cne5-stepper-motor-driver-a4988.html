I can't get the stepper motors to move on my DIY T8 CNC router. I'm 99% sure my wiring is correct, and I flashed GRBL successfully. I can turn the spindle on and off, but when I try to jog the steppers, the values on the screen go up and down but the motors do nothing. If anyone has any advice or even a clue as to what more I could test, I'd appreciate the help (I'm completely inexperienced). Things I know: My Arduino Uno clone has power My CNC shield has power My stepper motor driver. Learn about A4988 Stepper Motor Driver along with Pinout, Wiring, Arduino Code for Microstepping, Controlling Speed & Direction of NEMA 17 Stepper Motor. I have arduino nano and when i work with stepper motor drivers (A4988). When motor is powered via external power supply, my mouse and keyboard went crazy turning off and on. Arduino is connected with USB whole time. When I turn motor off, everything is back to normal. Does someone also have this problem, and is it dangerous for my motherboard and computer? P.S. sorry for weird English, Im not a native speaker. Using the driver Minimal wiring diagram for connecting a microcontroller to an A4988 stepper motor driver carrier (full-step mode). Power connections. Can someone explain to me how to figure out the correct current limiting on this stepper motor driver? A4988 driver (https://www.pololu.com/product/2128) Motor ( runs 24v with 10 ohm coils but says 500mA per phase 19.5V power supply I'm not sure how to figure out what the current limit should be.

Modern stepper motor drivers have "thermal shutdown" -- when they sense they are getting I've been building a macro focus stacking rail. It uses a stepper motor which turns a screw pushing a carriage forward on a frame. The carriage has a camera on it. The intention is to be able to move it a small amount \~10µm with each step and take a photo with the camera. It works somewhat, but, to my surprise, the motor sometimes steps backwards. In the linked video, the motor should be driven forwards at a constant rate, but instead, it stays still at some points, and at other points 
Making a stepper motor move is easy with an A4988 driver. I'll show you how with code and examples. I have a CR-10 mini and an anycubic kossel. I installed stepper dampers (the metal plates with rubber in the middle) to my CR-10 mini and it made a world of difference to the noise level. Now that I have a kossel, I wanted to quiet it down so I ordered another 3 dampers, which are still in the mail. The kossel's mainboard allows the drivers to be replaced, so I'm mulling over whether I should buy some TMC2208s to repace the stock A4988's. The intention is to improve print quality (less artefa.
